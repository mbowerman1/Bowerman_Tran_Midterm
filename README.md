## Background

We, as Hopkins students, are also part of the Baltimore community. Therefore, we are always interested in seeing what and why the city is lacking, as well as any positive developments and potential improvements. Combining that outlook with our interest in equity, we want to explore the business/entrepeneurial landscape of Baltimore city, specifically for groups that are perhaps overlooked or undersupported in their endeavors: women and minorities. In this project, we are studying women- and minority-owned Baltimore businesses contracted by the city government in order to potentially make out any business trends over past years or growth opportunities, and to comment on how city government funding and support has been allocated. Above all, we want to discover if these contract percentages are reflective of both business ownership and resident demographics. Additionally, we are comparing our findings to government contracts for women- and minority-owned businesses in New York City, to see if the issues and trends we detected are also present.

## Data and Information Sources

1) The minority and women's business data for Baltimore from 2013 was found using the [Open Baltimore data portal](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/ "Open Baltimore").
2) The minority and women's business data for New York City from 2020 was found using the [NYC Open Data portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ "NYC Open Data").
3) The general demographic data for all cities from 2012 was found using the [U.S. Census FactFinder portal](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml/ "American FactFinder"). After March 31, 2020, available [here](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/ "Census Data").
4) The general demographic data for all cities from 2020 was found [INSERT SOURCE HERE].

## Data Questions

1) What percentage of the city government's contracts are awarded to Minority and Women Business Enterprise-Certified companies?
2) Is this percentage reflective of city demographics and business ownership as a whole?
3) What are some interesting trends in city contracts and MBE/WBE-certified companies?
4) Can the data from both Baltimore and other cities be used to create a benchmark for the city government's contract diversity today?

## Data Analysis

We will look at:

1) Businesses' profiles: industry, owner's race and gender, scope and size of work (via contract sizes) for Baltimore
2) If any particular demographic(s) are outperforming others, and why
3) Whether contract details and numbers are reflective of city demographics
4) Comparable data for New York City
