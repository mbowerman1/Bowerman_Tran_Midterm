## Background

We, as Hopkins students, are also part of the Baltimore community. Therefore, we are always interested in seeing what and why the city is lacking, as well as any positive developments and potential improvements. Combining that outlook with our interest in equity, we want to explore the business/entrepeneurial landscape of Baltimore city, specifically for groups that are perhaps overlooked or undersupported in their endeavors: women and minorities. In this project, we are studying Baltimorean businesses owned and run by people of these demographics in order to potentially make out any business trends over past years or growth opportunities, and to comment on how city government funding and support has been allocated. Additionally, we are comparing our findings to women- and minority-owned businesses in New York City, to see if the issues and trends we detected are also present.
